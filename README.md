# Captive Portal Parameters

This repository is a collection of captive portal redirect parameters for various vendors' equipment (like Mikrotik, Ubiquiti, Draytek etc) and software packages (like Coova Chilli) as well as parameters and code required to authenticate users on those platforms.

*Notes on other systems that support captive portals*

#### pfSense, OPNSense, PacketFence, Sophos

These platforms only have an internal captive portal. They do not support external captive portals.
