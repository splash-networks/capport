# Captive Portal Parameters

This repository is a collection of captive portal redirect parameters for various vendors' equipment (like Mikrotik, Ubiquiti, Draytek etc) and software packages (like Coova Chilli) as well as parameters and code required to authenticate users on those platforms.

*Notes on other systems that support captive portals*

#### Coova Chilli ####

Many vendors use Coova Chilli as their captive portal package so the code given [here](https://github.com/splash-networks/capport/tree/master/Coova%20Chilli) will work for them. Some examples are Teltonika, Xirrus, LigoWave and OpenMesh. Some use Coova Chilli with slight variations, such as Cradlepoint and Plasma. Their codes are given in their respective folders.

#### pfSense, OPNSense, PacketFence, Sophos

These platforms only have an internal captive portal. They do not support external captive portals.
